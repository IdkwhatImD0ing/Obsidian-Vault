Functions.   

-   Like objects
    
-   Classes
    
-   Have methods and properties
    
- Objects can inherit properties
    
-   Will search up prototype chain
    
-   Can use Imperative, Functional and Arrow Function
    
-   Of
    
	-   Iterates over values
    
-   In
    
	-   Iterates over keys

Document Object Model:
