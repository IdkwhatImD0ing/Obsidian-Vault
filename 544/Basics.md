## Text Cleaning and Preprocessing

Cleaning is when we remove any unwanted characters, such as punctuation and special symbols, from the text.

Types
- Tokenization
	- Splitting text into units for processing
	- Removing spaces, urls, unhelpful characters etc
- Stemming
	- Word form stripped of some characters
	- Studying -> study
- Lemmatization
	- Base of a word
	- Tokenization, tokenize -> token
	- Went, gone, goes -> go
- Lemmatization can be lossy
