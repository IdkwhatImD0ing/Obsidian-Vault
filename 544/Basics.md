## Text Cleaning and Preprocessing

Cleaning is when we remove any unwanted characters, such as punctuation and special symbols, from the text.

Types
- Tokenization
	- Splitting text into units for processing
	- Removing spaces, urls, unhelpful characters etc
- Stemming
	- Word form stripped of some characters
	- Studying -> study
- Lemmatization
	- Base of a word
	- Tokenization, tokenize -> token
	- Went, gone, goes -> go
- Lemmatization can be lossy

## Feature Extraction

Feature extracion is when we represent language as a vector of veatures so they can be used as inputs to mathematical/statistical models.

Examples:
- Sentiment Analysis
- NER
- Deep learning festure extraction

## Machine Learning Models

Models can be grouped into categories

For example
- Classification
- Structured Prediction
- Machine Translation
