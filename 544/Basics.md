**Traditional NLP Pipeline**
- **Data Acquisition**: Collecting text data.
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary characters from text.
- **Preprocessing**: Preparing text for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Turning text into a format suitable for models.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Applying algorithms to learn from data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance.
- **Deployment**: Integrating the model into a usable environment.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously checking and updating the model as needed.

**Text Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- **Tokenization**: Dividing text into smaller parts (tokens) and removing irrelevant characters like spaces and URLs.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base form by stripping suffixes (e.g., "studying" to "study").
- **Lemmatization**: Transforming words into their root form (e.g., "went," "gone," "goes" to "go"). Note that this process might result in loss of information.

**Feature Extraction**
- Describes the process of representing language data as vectors of features to serve as inputs for models. Common applications include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and features for deep learning models.

**Machine Learning Models**
- **Classification**: Assigning categories to data points.
- **Structured Prediction**: Predicting structured data.
- **Machine Translation**: Automatically converting text from one language to another.

**Model Evaluation**
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of predictions that are correct.
- **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct (True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)).
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly (True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)).
- **F1 Score**: A measure that combines precision and recall using the harmonic mean (2 x (Precision x Recall) / (Precision + Recall)).

Example:

1. **Precision**: Imagine you've got a basket and you're trying to fill it only with red apples from a mixed pile of fruits. Precision is like checking how many of the fruits you picked are actually red apples. If you pick 100 fruits and 90 of them are red apples, your precision is really good because you mostly picked the right fruit. It's important because it shows you're not grabbing a bunch of stuff you don't need, like oranges or bananas.

2. **Recall**: Now, recall is a bit different. It's not about how many fruits you grabbed, but about how many red apples in the pile you managed to get into your basket. So, if there were 120 red apples in the pile and you picked up 100 of them, your recall is pretty high. This is crucial because it tells you if you're missing out on a lot of the red apples still left in the pile.

3. **F1 Score**: This one combines precision and recall into a single number. Itâ€™s like finding a balance between getting as many red apples as you can (recall) and making sure what you grab is mostly red apples (precision). If you only care about grabbing lots of apples, you might end up with too many oranges, but if you're too careful about only grabbing red apples, you might not pick very many. The F1 score helps make sure you're doing well at both grabbing a lot of apples and making sure they're the right kind.
