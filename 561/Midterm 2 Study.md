## True / False

 - Hill climbing is a complete search algorithm for global solutions and it never looks ahead beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state.
	 - False
	 - It is not a complete search algorithm for finding global solutions. Its a local search algorithm that moves to a local neighbor
	 - Can get stuck in local minima or local maxima
 - “The sentence A entails the sentence B” if and only if, in every model in which B is true, A is also true.
	 - False
	 - Entailment is opposite way around, if A is true, then B is true
 - An inference algorithm f is complete means that if A can inference B using f, then A entails B
	 - True
	 - Completeness theory says if A inference f to B, then A := B
 - An inference algorithm f is sound means that if A entails B, then A can inference B using f.
	 - False
	 - Soundness theory states that f is sound if and only if, whenever f can infer B from A, then it must mean A := B
 - A sentence is valid if it is true in all models.
	 - True
	 - Valid means it must hold under all circumstances
	 - Eg P and Not P
 - “From Hates(Alice, Exam) we can infer ∃x Hates(x, Exam)” applies the ExistentialElimination (EE) rule in First-order Logic.
	 - False,
