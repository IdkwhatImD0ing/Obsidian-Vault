## First Order Logic

### Problem 1

 - The first–order language of (directed) graphs is L = {r}, where r is a binary relation symbol.
 - The only terms are the variables ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z’ etc.
 - Atomic formulas look like (rxy).Universal and Existential quantifiers work the same way as they normally do.
Sometimes, smart people have a hard time understanding the above points, and since, you all are smart people, we want to explain the above points in simple terms:
 - For nodes/vertices/terms x and y in a (directed) graph G, rxy denotes that there is
an edge going from node x to node y in G.

1. The graph has at least two vertices. 
	1. ExEy(x != y)
2. Every vertex has an edge attached to it. 
	1. AxEy(rxy OR ryx()
3. Every vertex has at most two edges directed from it to other vertices. 
	1. AxAyAzAw((rxy AND rxz AND rxw)) => (y = z or y = W or z = w)
4. Every vertex has at least two edges directed from other vertices to it. 
	1. AxEyEz(y != z AND ryx AND rzx) (**Important, r arguments is flipped!!!**)
5. Write T for True, F for False: 
	1. “Every vertex has exactly one edge entering it” can be written as:
		1. ∀x∃y rxy ∧ ∀w∀v∀u (( rvw ∧ ruw ) ⇒ (v = u))
		2. False

### Problem 2
Consider a domain with the following relation.
 - ISPRIME(n) : n is a prime number
 - HasSS#(x,n) : x has the social security number n
 - Person(x): x is a person

 - Write T for True, F for False: 
	 - “Every even natural number n has 2 as it’s factor” can be written as: 
		 - ∀n. ( (n > 2 ∧ ∃k. n = 2k)
	 - False, expresses even, but doesnt state two is a factor
 - Goldbach’s Conjecture says that “Every even natural number n > 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."
	 - Write Goldbach’s Conjecture in First Order Logic. 
	 - ∀n(n>2∧∃k(n=2k)⇒∃p∃q(ISPRIME(p)∧ISPRIME(q)∧n=p+q))
 - Write T for True, F for False: 
	 - “No two people have the same social security number.” can be written as:
		 - ¬∃x,y,n Person(x) ∧ Person(y) ∧ HasSS#(x,n)∧ HasSS#(y,n) .
	 - True

## Inference

### Problem 1

1. We designed an exam, which has three parts (P1, P2 and P3) for two types of
examinees (E and non-E). For each part, there are three ranks (A, B and C). The result for the
entire exam is either pass or not pass.
Given the following sentences:
1. Any E examinee who gets an A in both part P1 and P2 will pass the exam.
2. Any non-E examinee who gets a C in part P3 or P2 won’t pass the exam.
3. Some non-E examinees who get a C or B in part P2 and pass the exam.
4. Alex is an E examinee getting an A in part P1 and Steve is a non-E examinee getting an A in part P3.
Translate the above sentences into First Order Logic using the following predicates: E(x) which means x is an E examinee R(x, y, z) which means examinee x gets a y in part z, and P(x) which means x passes the exam

1. **Any E examinee who gets an A in both part P1 and P2 will pass the exam.**
   - $\( \forall x \, ((E(x) \land R(x, \text{'A'}, \text{'P1'}) \land R(x, \text{'A'}, \text{'P2'})) \Rightarrow P(x)) \)$

2. **Any non-E examinee who gets a C in part P3 or P2 won't pass the exam.**
   - $\( \forall x \, ((\lnot E(x) \land (R(x, \text{'C'}, \text{'P3'}) \lor R(x, \text{'C'}, \text{'P2'}))) \Rightarrow \lnot P(x)) \)$

3. **Some non-E examinees who get a C or B in part P2 and pass the exam.**
   - $\( \exists x \, ((\lnot E(x) \land (R(x, \text{'C'}, \text{'P2'}) \lor R(x, \text{'B'}, \text{'P2'}))) \land P(x)) \)$

4. **Alex is an E examinee getting an A in part P1 and Steve is a non-E examinee getting an A in part P3.**
   - $\( E(\text{'Alex'}) \land R(\text{'Alex'}, \text{'A'}, \text{'P1'}) \land \lnot E(\text{'Steve'}) \land R(\text{'Steve'}, \text{'A'}, \text{'P3'}) \)$

## Planning
Stack is one of the basic data structures in programming. The following line is a stack, with 3 as its top element and 7 as its bottom:
Stack S: Head→3→7→5→4

For a stack, we have following basic actions:
	Pop(s): pop the top of stack s.
	Push(s, e): push element e to the top of stack s.

And the following conditions:
	IsHead(s, e1): e1 is the head of stack s. For example, in the given stack, we have IsHead(S, 3).
	IsEmpty(s): stack s is empty.
	NextTo(e1, e2): element e1 is the element before e2. For example, in the given stack, we have
	NextTo(3,7).

Note: In your answers, use “e1, e2, e3 ...” for non-constant elements, use variable “s” for
non-constant stack.
### A. Current Conditions for the Given Stack
Given the stack S: Head→3→7→5→4, the current conditions would be:

1. IsHead(S, 3)
2. NextTo(3, 7)
3. NextTo(7, 5)
4. NextTo(5, 4)

### B. Preconditions and Postconditions for `Pop(s)`

#### Situation 1:

Preconditions:
1. IsHead(s, e1)
2. IsEmpty(s) is False

Postconditions:
1. IsHead(s, e2)
2. NextTo(e1, e2)

### C. Preconditions and Postconditions for `Switch(e3, e4)`

For a subsequence e1→e2→e3→e4→e5:

Preconditions:
1. NextTo(e3, e4)
2. Larger(e3, e4)

Postconditions:
1. NextTo(e4, e3)
2. Larger(e4, e3) should be False

### D. Sequence of Actions to Sort the Stack

To sort the stack S: Head→3→7→5→4 so that the top element is the smallest, you could use the following sequence of actions:

1. Pop(S) (Current Stack: 7→5→4)
2. Pop(S) (Current Stack: 5→4)
3. Pop(S) (Current Stack: 4)
4. Pop(S) (Current Stack: [])
5. Push(S, 7)
6. Push(S, 5)
7. Push(S, 4)
8. Push(S, 3)

Now the Stack is sorted as Head→3->4->5->7
