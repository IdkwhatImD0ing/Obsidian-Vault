## What is Learning

Learning refers to the process of changes in a system that enable it to perform the same task more efficiently over time. It is fundamentally about improvement and enhancement.

## Why Study Learning

- **Automation**: Delegate mundane and repetitive tasks to machines.
- **Enhancement**: Understand and improve the efficiency of human learning processes.
- **Discovery**: Uncover new knowledge or structure in previously unexplored domains.
- **Completing Knowledge**: Address incomplete specifications about a particular domain.
- **Adaptability**: Develop agents capable of adapting to users, other agents, and their environment.

## Two Types of Learning

### Deductive Learning

- **Process**: Deductive learning involves deducing new rules or facts from already known rules or facts.
- **Nature**: It's a logical process where conclusions are based on the concordance of multiple premises that are generally assumed to be true.

### Inductive Learning

- **Process**: Inductive learning is about learning new rules or facts from a given dataset \( D \).
- **Nature**: It involves making generalizations based on specific instances or data points, often leading to the formulation of new hypotheses or theories.
