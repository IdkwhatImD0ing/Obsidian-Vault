Regular NNs use fully connected layer
but problem is that it loses the spatial knowledge

Solution is Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolution Layers, ReLu Layers, Pooling Layers
And fully connected layesr

Learn features from iamges

A kernel is a filter, it sweeps over a convolutional layer and checks to see if the image contains what the filter is trying to check
