### Gradient Descent (GD)
Simple and fundamental

Find minimum, by moving in negative gradient direction
### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Faster, effective for large scale problems

Computes gradient for subset of training set instead of full training set
Moving in a noisy negative gradient direction
