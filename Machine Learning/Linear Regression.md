Used to predict continuous values

Goal:
Minimize the total squared error

Can use Residual Sum of Squares, a function of w
W is weights, which affect how much the features affect the predicted value

Least squares solution, generally called empirical risk minimizer

Reduce machine learning to optmization

Can apply to any optimization algorithm but linear regression is closed form solution
