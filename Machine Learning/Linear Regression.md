Used to predict continuous values

Goal:
Minimize the total squared error

CAn use Residual Sum of Squares, a function of w

Least squares solution, generally called empirical risk minimizer

Reduce machine learning to optmization

Can apply to any optimization alogirhtm but linear regression is clsoed form solution
