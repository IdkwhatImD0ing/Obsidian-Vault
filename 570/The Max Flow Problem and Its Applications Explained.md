## Introduction

In network systems, the **Max Flow Problem** involves finding the greatest possible flow from a starting point (source) to an endpoint (sink) without exceeding the limits of the paths (capacities). Think of it like sending as much water as possible through a network of pipes without bursting any pipe.

**Example:** Shipping natural gas from Alaska to Texas through pipelines with certain capacities. We want to maximize the amount of gas shipped without exceeding the capacity of any pipeline.

## Key Concepts

### Flow Network

A **flow network** is a system represented by a directed graph G=(V,E)G = (V, E), where:

- **Vertices (VV)**: Points in the network (like junctions in a pipeline).
- **Edges (EE)**: Paths connecting the vertices (like pipes).
- **Capacities (c(u,v)c(u, v))**: Maximum flow allowed on each edge (u,v)(u, v).
- **Source (ss) and Sink (tt)**: Starting and ending points of the flow.

### Flow Function

A **flow** assigns a value to each edge, indicating how much "stuff" (like gas or water) is flowing through it. The flow function f:E→R+f: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+ must follow two main rules:

1. **Capacity Constraint**:
    $$
    0≤f(u,v)≤c(u,v)0 \leq f(u, v) \leq c(u, v)
    $$
    - The flow on an edge can't be negative or exceed its capacity.
2. **Conservation Constraint**:
    
    ∑incoming edgesf(u,v)=∑outgoing edgesf(v,w)for all v≠s,t\sum_{\text{incoming edges}} f(u, v) = \sum_{\text{outgoing edges}} f(v, w) \quad \text{for all } v \neq s, t
    - Except for the source and sink, the total flow into a node equals the total flow out.

**Goal:** Maximize the total flow from ss to tt while respecting these constraints.

## Solving the Max Flow Problem

### The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

This algorithm finds the maximum flow by repeatedly finding paths that can carry more flow and increasing the flow along those paths.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialize**:
    
    - Set all flows f(u,v)=0f(u, v) = 0.
    - Construct the **residual graph** GfG_f, which shows remaining capacities.
2. **Find an Augmenting Path**:
    
    - Look for a path from ss to tt where more flow can be sent (using Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search).
3. **Determine Bottleneck Capacity (δ\delta)**:
    
    - Find the smallest capacity along the path (this is the maximum additional flow we can send).
4. **Augment Flow**:
    
    - Increase the flow along the path by δ\delta.
5. **Update Residual Graph**:
    
    - Adjust capacities to reflect the new flow.
6. **Repeat**:
    
    - Go back to step 2 until no more augmenting paths are found.

#### Residual Graph Explained

The **residual graph** GfG_f helps us keep track of where more flow can go:

- **Forward Edges**: Represent remaining capacity c(u,v)−f(u,v)c(u, v) - f(u, v).
- **Backward Edges**: Allow us to reduce flow on an edge if needed (capacity f(u,v)f(u, v)).

#### Time Complexity

- The running time is O(∣fmax∣⋅(E+V))O(|f_{\text{max}}| \cdot (E + V)), where ∣fmax∣|f_{\text{max}}| is the maximum flow value.
- Not strongly polynomial because it depends on the magnitude of flow values.

#### Why It Works

- **Termination**: If capacities are whole numbers, the flow increases by at least 1 each time, so the algorithm will stop eventually.
- **Maximum Flow**: When no more paths can be found, the current flow is as big as possible.

## Understanding Cuts and the Max Flow-Min Cut Theorem

### What is a Cut?

A **cut** in a flow network is a way to split the nodes into two groups:

- **Set AA**: Contains the source ss.
- **Set BB**: Contains the sink tt.

The **capacity of the cut** c(A,B)c(A, B) is the total capacity of edges going from AA to BB.

### The Max Flow-Min Cut Theorem

- **Statement**: The maximum flow from ss to tt is equal to the smallest (minimum) cut capacity that separates ss from tt. Maximum Flow=Minimum Cut Capacity\text{Maximum Flow} = \text{Minimum Cut Capacity}
- **Meaning**: No matter how you try, you can't send more flow than the weakest link (smallest cut) allows.

### Proof Concepts

- **Forward Proof**: Shows that the flow cannot exceed any cut's capacity.
- **Backward Proof**: Demonstrates that if a flow equals a cut's capacity, it's the maximum possible.

## Bipartite Matching and Network Flow

### Bipartite Graphs

- A graph is **bipartite** if its nodes can be split into two groups XX and YY such that all edges go from XX to YY.
- There are no edges between nodes within the same group.

### Matching in Bipartite Graphs

- A **matching** is a set of edges where no two edges share a common node.
- A **maximum matching** has the largest possible number of edges.

### Solving Matching with Flow Networks

We can find the maximum matching by converting the bipartite graph into a flow network.

#### Steps to Reduce Bipartite Matching to Max Flow:

1. **Create a Flow Network**:
    
    - Add a **source node ss** connected to all nodes in XX.
    - Add a **sink node tt** connected from all nodes in YY.
    - For every edge (x,y)(x, y) in the bipartite graph, add it to the network.
2. **Set Capacities**:
    
    - All edges have a capacity of **1** (since each node can be matched at most once).
3. **Find Maximum Flow**:
    
    - Use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the flow from ss to tt.
4. **Interpret the Flow as a Matching**:
    
    - The flow of **1** along an edge (x,y)(x, y) means xx is matched with yy.
    - The maximum flow value equals the size of the maximum matching.

#### Time Complexity

- The process runs in polynomial time O(VE)O(VE), efficient for practical use.

## Practical Example: Using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

Imagine a small network:

- **Nodes**: s,a,b,ts, a, b, t
- **Edges and Capacities**:
    - s→as \rightarrow a (capacity 3)
    - s→bs \rightarrow b (capacity 2)
    - a→ba \rightarrow b (capacity 1)
    - a→ta \rightarrow t (capacity 2)
    - b→tb \rightarrow t (capacity 3)

**Steps**:

1. **Initialize Flows**: All flows are 0.
    
2. **Find Augmenting Paths**:
    
    - **First Path**: s→a→ts \rightarrow a \rightarrow t
        
        - Bottleneck capacity: δ=2\delta = 2 (minimum of capacities 3 and 2)
        - Increase flows along this path by 2.
    - **Second Path**: s→b→ts \rightarrow b \rightarrow t
        
        - Bottleneck capacity: δ=2\delta = 2 (minimum of capacities 2 and 3)
        - Increase flows along this path by 2.
3. **Update Residual Graph**: Adjust capacities.
    
4. **No More Paths**: Can't find a new path from ss to tt with available capacity.
    
5. **Maximum Flow**: Total flow from ss to tt is 2+2=42 + 2 = 4.
