## 1. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

### What Is the TSP?

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic optimization problem:

- Imagine a salesperson who needs to visit a list of cities.
- They must start from their home city, visit each city **exactly once**, and return to the starting city.
- The goal is to find the **shortest possible route** that satisfies these conditions.

**Visualization:**

Imagine a map with dots representing cities and lines representing roads with distances. The salesperson wants the shortest round-trip route covering all cities.

### Example

Suppose there are four cities: A, B, C, and D. The distances between them are as follows:

- A to B: 10 units
- A to C: 15 units
- A to D: 20 units
- B to C: 35 units
- B to D: 25 units
- C to D: 30 units

The salesperson needs to find the shortest route that starts and ends at city A and visits B, C, and D exactly once.

## 2. Is TSP in NP? Is TSP NP-Complete?

### What Does "In NP" Mean?

- **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time)**: A class of problems for which a solution can be **verified** quickly (in polynomial time) by a deterministic algorithm.
- **Polynomial Time**: An algorithm runs in polynomial time if its running time can be expressed as a polynomial function of the size of the input (like $n$, $n^2$, $n^3$).

**Explanation of Terms:**

- **Deterministic Algorithm**: An algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output following a predictable sequence of steps.
- **Nondeterministic Algorithm**: An algorithm that can make "guesses" or choose from multiple options at each step. In theory, it explores all possible choices simultaneously to find a solution.

### Is TSP in NP?

- **Yes**, the TSP is in NP.
- **Why?**

  - Given a proposed route (a sequence of cities), we can:

    - Verify that it visits each city exactly once.
    - Verify that it starts and ends at the specified city.
    - Calculate the total length of the route.
    - Check if the total length is less than a given value.

  - These checks can be done quickly, in polynomial time.

### Is TSP NP-Complete?

- **Yes**, the **decision version** of TSP is NP-Complete.
- The **optimization version** (finding the shortest possible route) is NP-Hard.

## 3. Decision Version of TSP and NP-Completeness

### Decision Version of TSP

- **Problem Statement**:

  - Given:

    - A set of cities.
    - Distances between each pair of cities.
    - A number $k$.

  - Question: Is there a tour (route) that:

    - Starts and ends at a specified city.
    - Visits each city exactly once.
    - Has a total length less than or equal to $k$?

### Proving TSP is NP-Complete

To prove that the decision version of TSP is NP-Complete, we can reduce a known NP-Complete problem to TSP.

#### Reduction from Hamiltonian Cycle (HC) to TSP

1. **Hamiltonian Cycle (HC)**:

   - A cycle that visits every vertex (city) exactly once and returns to the starting point.
   - **HC Problem**: Does a given graph have a Hamiltonian cycle?

2. **Reduction Process**:

   - **Input**: A graph $G = (V, E)$.
   - **Construct**: A complete graph $G' = (V', E')$ where:

     - $V' = V$ (same set of vertices).
     - **Edge Costs**:

       - $c(u, v) = 1$ if $(u, v) \in E$ (edge exists in $G$).
       - $c(u, v) = 2$ if $(u, v) \notin E$ (edge does not exist in $G$).

   - **Set** $k = |V|$ (the number of vertices).

3. **Claim**:

   - $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle **if and only if** $G'$ has a tour of total cost $\leq k$.

#### Proof of NP-Completeness

- **Forward Direction ($\Rightarrow$)**:

  - If $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle, then:

    - This cycle uses only edges from $G$, which have cost 1 in $G'$.
    - Total cost of the tour in $G'$ is $|V| \times 1 = |V| = k$.

- **Backward Direction ($\Leftarrow$)**:

  - If $G'$ has a tour of total cost $\leq k$:

    - Since edges not in $G$ have cost 2, using any of them would exceed the total cost $k$.
    - Therefore, the tour uses only edges of cost 1, which correspond to edges in $G$.
    - Thus, these edges form a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$.

- **Conclusion**:

  - Finding such a tour in $G'$ solves the Hamiltonian Cycle problem in $G$.
  - Since HC is NP-Complete, and we can reduce it to TSP, the decision version of TSP is NP-Complete.

## 4. Approximation Algorithms

### What Are Approximation Algorithms?

- Algorithms designed to find **near-optimal** solutions to optimization problems.
- Used when finding the exact optimal solution is too time-consuming (e.g., NP-Hard problems).
- Provide solutions that are **good enough** and can be computed efficiently (in polynomial time).

### Why Use Approximation Algorithms?

- For NP-Hard problems, exact solutions may not be feasible for large instances.
- Approximation algorithms offer a trade-off between solution quality and computation time.

## 5. Greedy Approximation for Graph Coloring

### The Graph Coloring Problem

- **Objective**: Assign colors to vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Goal**: Use the minimum number of colors possible.
- **Application**: Scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and more.
- **Challenge**: Determining the minimum number of colors is NP-Hard.

### Greedy Approximation Algorithm

**Idea**:

- Use a simple strategy to color the graph efficiently, though not necessarily optimally.

**Steps**:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices.
   - Available colors: Integers $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$.

2. **Order Vertices**:

   - Arrange the vertices in order of decreasing degree (number of connections).

3. **Coloring Process**:

   - **First Color**:

     - Assign color 1 to the first vertex (highest degree).
     - For each subsequent vertex:

       - If it is **not adjacent** to any vertex already colored with color 1, assign color 1.

     - Remove all vertices colored with color 1 from consideration.

   - **Subsequent Colors**:

     - Repeat the process with the remaining uncolored vertices, using the next available color each time.

4. **Termination**:

   - Continue until all vertices are colored.

**Example**:

- Suppose we have 5 vertices labeled A-E.
- Degrees: A(4), B(3), C(2), D(2), E(1).
- **Coloring**:

  - **Color 1**: Assign to A.
  - **Color 2**: Assign to B (since B is adjacent to A).
  - **Color 1**: Assign to E (not adjacent to A).
  - **Color 3**: Assign to C and D (since they are adjacent to A or B).

- **Result**: Used 3 colors.

**Note**:

- This algorithm doesn't guarantee the minimum number of colors but provides a quick solution.

## 6. Formal Definitions of Approximation Algorithms

### Minimization Problems

- **Goal**: Minimize a certain value (e.g., cost, length).
- **Definition**:

  - Let $P$ be a minimization problem.
  - Let $I$ be an instance of $P$.
  - Let $\text{OPT}(I)$ be the optimal (minimum) solution for $I$.
  - Let $\text{ALG}(I)$ be the solution provided by an approximation algorithm.

- **Approximation Ratio ($\alpha$)**:

  - $\alpha \geq 1$ such that:
    $$
    \text{ALG}(I) \leq \alpha \times \text{OPT}(I)
    $$
  - **Interpretation**: The algorithm's solution is at most $\alpha$ times the optimal solution.

### Maximization Problems

- **Goal**: Maximize a certain value (e.g., profit, score).
- **Definition**:

  - $0 < \alpha \leq 1$ such that:
    $$
    \text{ALG}(I) \geq \alpha \times \text{OPT}(I)
    $$
  - **Interpretation**: The algorithm's solution is at least $\alpha$ times the optimal solution.

### Purpose of Approximation Ratio

- Provides a **guarantee** on how close the algorithm's solution is to the optimal.
- Helps in evaluating and comparing approximation algorithms.

## 7. What Is a 2-Approximation Algorithm?

A **2-approximation algorithm** is an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio $\alpha = 2$.

### For Minimization Problems

- **Definition**:

  - The algorithm's solution is **at most twice** the optimal solution.
    $$
    \text{ALG}(I) \leq 2 \times \text{OPT}(I)
    $$

### Example: Vertex Cover Problem

- **Problem**: Find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is connected to at least one vertex in the set.

- **Simple 2-Approximation Algorithm**:

  1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty set $C$.
  2. **While** there are edges left in the graph:

     - Pick any edge $(u, v)$.
     - Add both $u$ and $v$ to $C$.
     - Remove all edges connected to $u$ or $v$ from the graph.

  3. **Result**: $C$ is a vertex cover.

- **Approximation Ratio**:

  - The size of $C$ is at most **twice** the size of the minimum vertex cover.
  - **Reasoning**:

    - In the worst case, the optimal solution selects one vertex per edge.
    - The algorithm selects both vertices for each edge, doubling the size.

### Importance

- Even though we can't efficiently find the optimal solution, we can find a solution that's within a factor of 2.
