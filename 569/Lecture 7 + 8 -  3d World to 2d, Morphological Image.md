perspective camera model
X,Y,Z) world coordinates

Orthographic versus Perspective Projections  
Orthographic projection does not include perspective foreshortening;  
namely, a viewing box whose sides are parallel, instead of one whose  
sides meet in a point at the scene's horizon

• In the context of image processing  
• Input: binary images
