# Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) & Bag of Words Model

## 1. Overview of Feature Detectors

Before diving into SIFT, it is useful to recall some basic types of feature detectors that help identify important structures in images:

- **Edge Detector:**  
  Separates two regions by detecting abrupt intensity changes. An edge is essentially the boundary between two different regions.

- **Blob Detector:**  
  Identifies regions that differ in properties (such as brightness or color) compared to surrounding areas. For example, it can detect a thin line or a circular spot that stands out from the background.

- **Corner Detector:**  
  Detects points where two or more edges intersect. Corners represent locations with well-defined and significant changes in gradient direction.

*Note:* The popular Harris corner detector is effective in achieving rotation invariance but does not inherently handle changes in scale.

## 2. Introduction to SIFT

**Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** was proposed by David Lowe at ICCV 1999. The main goal of SIFT is to generate a set of robust image features—known as keypoints—that satisfy the following properties:
- **Scale Invariance:** Keypoints are detectable at various scales.
- **Rotation Invariance:** Keypoints remain identifiable regardless of the image orientation.
- **Partial Invariance to Illumination and 3D Camera Viewpoint Changes:** SIFT is designed to be robust against variations in lighting and moderate perspective changes.
- **High Distinctiveness:** The features are sufficiently unique to enable reliable matching across images.
- **Extractable from Typical Images:** SIFT keypoints can be computed efficiently even on standard images.

Additionally, concepts from 1D blob manipulation are used as an analogy:  
- **1D Blob:** The idea involves using the first derivative (for edge detection) and the second derivative (to detect blob-like structures) to capture key features. In the 2D case, the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) approximates the scale-normalized Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG).

## 3. SIFT Pipeline Overview

The SIFT algorithm can be broken down into four major stages:

1. **Scale-Space Extrema Detection:**  
   Detect potential keypoints by looking for scale-space extrema in the Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) function.

2. **Keypoint Localization:**  
   Accurately locate the keypoints in both space and scale by fitting a model to determine sub-pixel and sub-scale accuracy.

3. **Orientation Assignment:**  
   Assign one or more orientations to each keypoint to ensure invariance to image rotation.

4. **Keypoint Descriptor Construction:**  
   Build a robust descriptor from local image gradients around the keypoint.

## 4. Scale-Space Extrema Detection

### 4.1. The Role of Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG)

- **Objective:**  
  Identify points in the image that exhibit maximum or minimum values in the scale space.  
- **How It Works:**  
  The DoG function is computed by subtracting two images blurred with Gaussian filters at different scales. Mathematically, if $G(x, y, \sigma)$ is a Gaussian function at scale $\sigma$, then:
  $$ D(x, y, \sigma) = G(x, y, k\sigma) - G(x, y, \sigma) $$
- **Approximation:**  
  The DoG closely approximates the scale-normalized Laplacian-of-Gaussian ($\sigma^2 \nabla^2 G$) while inherently incorporating the required $\sigma^2$ normalization for scale invariance.
- **Selection Criteria:**  
  A candidate keypoint is selected only if it is a local extreme (minimum or maximum) in the 3D (x, y, scale) DoG space.

*Example:* Consider an image of a building where windows and corners generate strong responses in the DoG space. The algorithm will select these as candidate keypoints for further processing.

## 5. Keypoint Localization

### 5.1. Refining Keypoint Positions

- **Objective:**  
  Determine the precise location (including sub-pixel accuracy) and scale of each keypoint.
- **Method:**  
  A 3D quadratic function is fitted to the local sample points around a candidate keypoint using a Taylor series expansion. The expansion (with the sample point as the origin) is given by:
  $$ D(\mathbf{X}) = D + \frac{\partial D}{\partial \mathbf{X}}^T \mathbf{X} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{X}^T \frac{\partial^2 D}{\partial \mathbf{X}^2} \mathbf{X} $$
  where $\mathbf{X} = (x, y, \sigma)^T$ represents the offset from the sample point.
  
- **Key Step:**  
  The derivative with respect to $\mathbf{X}$ is set to zero:
  $$ \frac{\partial D}{\partial \mathbf{X}} + \frac{\partial^2 D}{\partial \mathbf{X}^2} \mathbf{X} = 0 $$
  This yields a $3 \times 3$ linear system whose solution gives the refined keypoint location.
  
- **Finite Difference Approximation:**  
  Derivatives are approximated using finite differences.
  
- **Repeat Process:**  
  If any component of the offset is greater than 0.5 (in any dimension), the localization process is repeated for greater accuracy.

### 5.2. Post-Processing and Filtering

- **Low Contrast Elimination:**  
  Keypoints with low contrast are removed using the criterion:
  $$ |D(\mathbf{X})| < 0.03 $$
- **Edge Response Elimination:**  
  The stability of a keypoint is also gauged by analyzing the curvature of $D$ using the Hessian matrix $H$. Compute the ratio:
  $$ \text{Ratio} = \frac{(\operatorname{trace}(H))^2}{\det(H)} $$
  If this ratio exceeds $\frac{(r+1)^2}{r}$ (with $r = 10$ as used in SIFT), the keypoint is discarded. This step prevents poorly defined edge responses from being selected.

*Example:* In a scene with repetitive textures (like window grids), this filtering ensures that only well-localized keypoints (with strong, distinct features) are retained.

## 6. Keypoint Orientation Assignment

### 6.1. Achieving Rotation Invariance

- **Process:**
  1. **Neighborhood Selection:**  
     For each refined keypoint, a neighborhood is taken based on the keypoint’s scale.
     
  2. **Gradient Computation:**  
     Compute both the magnitude and direction of the gradient for each pixel within the neighborhood.
     
  3. **Orientation Histogram:**  
     An orientation histogram with 36 bins is constructed, covering $360^\circ$ (each bin spans $10^\circ$). The gradient magnitudes contribute to the histogram entries, with additional weighting by a Gaussian window whose $\sigma$ is 1.5 times the keypoint scale.
     
  4. **Dominant Orientation:**  
     The peak of the histogram determines the keypoint’s main orientation. To enhance robustness, any peak within 80% of the highest peak is also considered. This means a single keypoint may result in multiple descriptors at the same location and scale but with different orientations.

*Example:* A keypoint located on a curved edge may produce multiple strong orientation responses. Assigning multiple orientations helps maintain consistency during matching even if the object is rotated.

## 7. SIFT Descriptor Construction

### 7.1. Building the Descriptor

- **Region Selection:**  
  A $16 \times 16$ pixel neighborhood is taken around each keypoint.
  
- **Subdivision:**  
  The neighborhood is divided into 16 sub-regions (each of size $4 \times 4$).
  
- **Orientation Histogram per Sub-region:**  
  For every $4 \times 4$ sub-block, an 8-bin orientation histogram is computed.  
  $$ \text{Total Descriptor Size} = 16 \text{ blocks} \times 8 \text{ bins} = 128 $$
  
- **Descriptor Vector:**  
  The concatenated histogram bins form a 128-dimensional vector. Each entry represents the contribution from a specific spatial location and orientation.
  
- **Normalization:**  
  The descriptor vector is normalized to unit length to reduce the impact of illumination changes.
  
- **Clipping and Renormalizing:**  
  To reduce the effects of non-linear illumination changes, elements are capped at a value of 0.2 (an experimentally determined threshold) and the vector is renormalized.

### 7.2. Descriptor Dimensions and Variants

- **Dimensions:**  
  The complete descriptor accounts for the three dimensions: spatial coordinates $(x, y)$ and orientation $\theta$.  
- **PCA-SIFT:**  
  An alternative to the standard SIFT descriptor is PCA-SIFT. Here, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the gradient patch, reducing the descriptor dimension to 20. This variant tends to be more robust and computationally faster while retaining the key information.

*Example:* When matching features between a photo of a landmark taken from different angles, the normalized 128-dimensional SIFT descriptor (or the more compact 20-dimensional PCA-SIFT) provides a robust basis for determining correspondences.

## 8. Object Detection Using SIFT

SIFT keypoints and descriptors form the foundation for robust object detection:

- **Database Creation:**  
  Extract SIFT keypoints from a set of training images to build a database.
  
- **Matching:**  
  When detecting objects, keypoints from an input image are matched against the database using a nearest neighbor search on the descriptor vectors.
  
- **Application:**  
  This method is widely used in tasks such as object recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction.

*Example:* In a system designed to recognize paintings in a museum, SIFT keypoints extracted from the painting images are stored. When a visitor takes a picture, the system matches its keypoints with the database to identify the artwork.

## 9. The Bag of Words (BoW) Model in Computer Vision

### 9.1. Concept Overview

The Bag of Words model transforms an object (or image) into a collection of visual "words." These words correspond to distinctive features extracted from the image.

### 9.2. Steps in the BoW Model

1. **Feature Detection and Representation:**
   - Detection methods include:
     - **Sliding Windows / Regular Grid:** Systematically sample features across the image.
     - **Interest Point Detectors:** Use techniques like SIFT for robust keypoint selection.
     - **Alternative Methods:**  
       - Random sampling (e.g., Ullman et al. 2002)  
       - Segmentation-based patches (e.g., Barnard et al. 2003, Russell et al. 2006)

2. **Feature Clustering:**
   - Once features are extracted (using representations such as filter bank responses, image patches, or SIFT descriptors), they are clustered—typically using k-means.
   - The centers of these clusters form the dictionary (or codebook) of visual words.

3. **Image Representation:**
   - Each image is then represented as a histogram of visual word occurrences.
   - This histogram is used for tasks like categorization and recognition by comparing the “word frequencies” across images.

### 9.3. Key Phenomena in Visual Words

- **Visual Polysemy:**  
  A single visual word may appear in different (albeit locally similar) parts of different object categories. For instance, the same texture might occur in both leaves and tree bark.

- **Visual Synonyms:**  
  Different visual words might represent a similar part of an object. For example, two distinct descriptors could both represent the wheel of a motorbike.

*Example:* Imagine constructing a BoW model for cityscape images. Different keypoints corresponding to windows, doors, and road signs are clustered into visual words. Even if the same window appears with slight variations across buildings (polysemy) or two different patterns represent similar window structures (synonyms), the histogram captures these regularities for effective classification.

## 10. Conclusion

- **SIFT** provides a robust method for detecting and describing distinctive, invariant keypoints across images. Its multi-step process—from scale-space extrema detection and precise localization to orientation assignment and descriptor construction—ensures reliability under variations of scale, rotation, illumination, and moderate viewpoint changes.
- **Bag of Words Models** transform these individual descriptors into a holistic image representation, enabling tasks such as object detection and recognition through statistical analysis and clustering.

These approaches are foundational in computer vision, forming the basis for many modern applications in image matching, 3D reconstruction, and automated recognition systems.
