## 1. 2D Transformation Matrices and Homogeneous Coordinates

While in pure linear algebra a 2D linear transformation (rotation or scaling) can be represented by a 2×2 matrix, working with images usually requires us to also apply translations. To combine linear (rotation, scaling, etc.) and translation operations in one framework, we use _homogeneous coordinates_. This means every 2D point (x,y)(x, y) is represented as a 3-element column vector:

(xy1).\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.

Accordingly, the transformation matrices become 3×3. In this system, translations, which cannot be handled by 2×2 matrices alone, are included as follows:

T(tx,ty)=(10tx01ty001).T(t_x,t_y)= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & t_x \\ 0 & 1 & t_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.

For pure rotations or scalings (without translation), you could think of using a 2×2 matrix, but for consistency and to allow concatenation with translation, we use their 3×3 homogeneous forms.

## 2. Reverse Mapping

**Forward Mapping vs. Reverse Mapping**

- **Forward Mapping** computes the output coordinate directly from a given input coordinate using a transformation matrix. While this seems direct, it may lead to gaps (holes) in the output image because multiple input pixels might map to nearby output pixels or even skip some output locations.
    
- **Reverse Mapping** works in the opposite direction: for each pixel in the output image, it calculates where that pixel comes from in the input image using the inverse of the transformation matrix. This way, every output pixel is assigned a value by “pulling” from the corresponding position in the input image. Reverse mapping is essential because it avoids holes and ensures that every pixel in the destination image receives a valid interpolated intensity.
    

---

## 3. Bilinear Interpolation

When using reverse mapping, the computed source coordinate is often a non-integer (floating point) value. Since image pixels are defined at integer coordinates, **bilinear interpolation** is used to estimate the pixel value at these non-integer coordinates. It works as follows:

1. **Identify the four nearest pixels:** If the computed coordinate is (x′,y′)(x', y'), let
    
    x1=⌊x′⌋,x2=⌈x′⌉,y1=⌊y′⌋,y2=⌈y′⌉.x_1 = \lfloor x'\rfloor,\quad x_2 = \lceil x'\rceil,\quad y_1 = \lfloor y'\rfloor,\quad y_2 = \lceil y'\rceil.
2. **Compute the distances:** Calculate the weights based on the distance of x′x' and y′y' to these four neighbors.
    
3. **Interpolate along x and then y:**  
    First, interpolate along the xx-direction for y1y_1 and y2y_2, then combine these results by interpolating along yy.
    

This method produces smoother results than simple nearest-neighbor interpolation, particularly noticeable in rotated or scaled images.

## 4. Example Matrices

Below are numerical examples for each transformation. For consistency we use homogeneous 3×3 matrices.

### A. Translation Matrices

Assume d=20d = 20 pixels.

- **Translate Right by 20 Pixels:**
    
    Tright(20)=(1020010001).T_{\text{right}}(20) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 20 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
- **Translate Left by 20 Pixels:**
    
    Tleft(20)=(10−20010001).T_{\text{left}}(20) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -20 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
- **Translate Down by 20 Pixels:**
    
    Tdown(20)=(1000120001).T_{\text{down}}(20) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 20 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
- **Translate Up by 20 Pixels:**
    
    Tup(20)=(10001−20001).T_{\text{up}}(20) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & -20 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.

### B. Rotation Matrices

Let’s use a 30° angle for our examples.

- **Rotate Counterclockwise (Left Rotate) by 30°:**
    
    The standard rotation matrix (about the origin) in homogeneous coordinates is:
    
    RCCW(30∘)=(cos⁡30∘−sin⁡30∘0sin⁡30∘cos⁡30∘0001).R_{CCW}(30^\circ)= \begin{pmatrix} \cos30^\circ & -\sin30^\circ & 0 \\ \sin30^\circ & \cos30^\circ & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
    
    Numerically, since cos⁡30∘≈0.866\cos30^\circ \approx 0.866 and sin⁡30∘≈0.5\sin30^\circ \approx 0.5:
    
    RCCW(30∘)≈(0.866−0.500.50.8660001).R_{CCW}(30^\circ) \approx \begin{pmatrix} 0.866 & -0.5 & 0 \\ 0.5 & 0.866 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
- **Rotate Clockwise (Right Rotate) by 30°:**
    
    For a clockwise rotation, use −30∘-30^\circ:
    
    RCW(30∘)=(cos⁡(−30∘)−sin⁡(−30∘)0sin⁡(−30∘)cos⁡(−30∘)0001).R_{CW}(30^\circ)= \begin{pmatrix} \cos(-30^\circ) & -\sin(-30^\circ) & 0 \\ \sin(-30^\circ) & \cos(-30^\circ) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
    
    Since cos⁡(−30∘)=cos⁡30∘≈0.866\cos(-30^\circ)=\cos30^\circ \approx 0.866 and sin⁡(−30∘)=−sin⁡30∘≈−0.5\sin(-30^\circ)=-\sin30^\circ\approx -0.5:
    
    RCW(30∘)≈(0.8660.50−0.50.8660001).R_{CW}(30^\circ) \approx \begin{pmatrix} 0.866 & 0.5 & 0 \\ -0.5 & 0.866 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.

### C. Scaling (Zoom In and Out)

- **Zoom In (Uniform Scaling, Factor k>1k > 1)**
    
    For example, using a zoom factor of k=1.5k = 1.5:
    
    Szoom in(1.5)=(1.50001.50001).S_{\text{zoom in}}(1.5) = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
- **Zoom Out (Uniform Scaling, Factor k<1k < 1)**
    
    For example, using a zoom factor of k=0.75k = 0.75:
    
    Szoom out(0.75)=(0.750000.750001).S_{\text{zoom out}}(0.75) = \begin{pmatrix} 0.75 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.75 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.

---

## Summary

- **Homogeneous (3×3) matrices** are used to represent 2D transformations that combine linear transformations (rotation, scaling) with translations.
    
- **Reverse mapping** means for each output pixel you compute the corresponding input pixel using the inverse transformation, ensuring every output pixel gets a value.
    
- **Bilinear interpolation** estimates pixel values at non-integer coordinates by taking a weighted average of the four nearest pixels, yielding smoother image transformations.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Translation right:  
        (1020010001)\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 20\\0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        
    - Translation left:  
        (10−20010001)\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & -20\\0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        
    - Rotate counterclockwise (left) by 30°:  
        ≈(0.866−0.500.50.8660001)\approx \begin{pmatrix}0.866 & -0.5 & 0\\0.5 & 0.866 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        
    - Rotate clockwise (right) by 30°:  
        ≈(0.8660.50−0.50.8660001)\approx \begin{pmatrix}0.866 & 0.5 & 0\\-0.5 & 0.866 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        
    - Zoom in (scale factor 1.5):  
        (1.50001.50001)\begin{pmatrix}1.5 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1.5 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        
    - Zoom out (scale factor 0.75):  
        (0.750000.750001)\begin{pmatrix}0.75 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0.75 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}.
        

These examples and explanations should help you understand and apply geometric modifications using both forward and reverse mapping techniques along with appropriate interpolation methods.

Reverse mapping and bilinear interpolation become important when the transformation does not neatly map integer pixel coordinates to integer pixel coordinates. Although a simple translation by an integer number of pixels might be performed directly, here's when and why you’d use these techniques:

---

### 1. Reverse Mapping

**When to Use:**

- **Non-integer Transformations:**  
    If the translation involves fractional (subpixel) shifts (for example, translating by 5.3 pixels right or 7.7 pixels down), the destination pixel positions won’t correspond exactly to integer positions in the source image. Reverse mapping computes, for every output pixel, the precise corresponding source location using the inverse of the transformation matrix.
    
- **Composite Transformations:**  
    Even when one part of the transformation is a translation, if it’s combined with other operations like rotation or scaling, the net transformation is unlikely to map input pixels to exact integer positions. Reverse mapping ensures every output pixel “pulls” a value from the appropriate source location.
    
- **Avoiding Holes:**  
    Direct or forward mapping can create gaps (holes) in the output image if the mapping causes multiple source pixels to merge or if some output pixels are not reached. Reverse mapping, by computing the source coordinate for every destination pixel, prevents these issues.
    

---

### 2. Bilinear Interpolation

**When to Use:**

- **Fractional Coordinates:**  
    When reverse mapping computes a source coordinate that is not an integer (e.g., (23.4, 45.7)), you cannot directly assign a pixel intensity value from the source image because pixel intensities are defined at integer grid locations. Bilinear interpolation estimates the intensity at these fractional positions by taking a weighted average of the four nearest pixels. This produces a smoother and more visually appealing output.
    
- **Smooth Appearance:**  
    Without interpolation, if you were to simply round to the nearest integer pixel, the output image would show aliasing artifacts or discontinuities, especially noticeable in transformations involving rotation or slight translations. Bilinear interpolation smooths over these artifacts.
    

---

### 3. Example in the Context of Translation

- **Integer Translation (e.g., 20 pixels right):**  
    For a translation matrix
    
    Tright=(1020010001),T_{\text{right}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 20 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},
    
    if you are moving every pixel exactly 20 pixels to the right, each output pixel directly corresponds to an input pixel at an integer location. In such cases, you might not strictly need bilinear interpolation. However, many implementations still apply reverse mapping to systematically compute the source coordinates and fill every destination pixel.
    
- **Non-integer Translation (e.g., 20.5 pixels right):**  
    Consider a translation by 20.5 pixels right:
    
    Tright=(1020.5010001).T_{\text{right}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 20.5 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
    
    Here, when you compute the source coordinate for a given output pixel via the inverse transformation, you might get coordinates like (x−20.5,y)(x - 20.5, y) which are fractional.
    
    - **Reverse Mapping:**  
        For each output pixel, compute the exact source position.
        
    - **Bilinear Interpolation:**  
        Since (x−20.5,y)(x - 20.5, y) is non-integer, you use bilinear interpolation to calculate the pixel’s value by averaging the intensities of the four surrounding integer pixels from the source image, weighted appropriately by the distances.
        

---

### Summary

- **Reverse Mapping:**  
    You use reverse mapping in any situation where the transformation (including translation) does not align output pixels exactly to input pixels. This technique is essential to ensure every output pixel is assigned a value (thus avoiding holes) even when dealing with rotations, scalings, or non-integer translations.
    
- **Bilinear Interpolation:**  
    This is applied after reverse mapping when the computed source coordinates are fractional. It ensures that pixel intensities are smoothly estimated rather than abruptly rounded, thereby enhancing the visual quality of the transformed image.
    

Thus, while for simple integer translations you might avoid bilinear interpolation, most practical scenarios — particularly when combining multiple types of transformations or using fractional offsets — require both reverse mapping and bilinear interpolation for correct and smooth image transformation.

Below is an explanation of what you can generally expect when applying each of these morphological filters to a binary object. Although the precise outcome may depend on the specific algorithm and the details of your binary patterns, here’s a typical overview:

---

### Shrinking

- **Purpose:**  
    Shrinking (sometimes called “ultimate erosion”) is designed to reduce each connected object to a minimal representation by iteratively removing boundary pixels. The process uses a set of structuring elements with the hit-or-miss transform, ensuring that removing a pixel does not break the object's connectivity.
    
- **Typical Result:**  
    For a well-behaved shape (like a filled square or circle), the entire object is reduced to a single pixel, ideally the one closest to the centroid.  
    **Example Visualization:**  
    Suppose your object is a rectangle; after shrinking, it might look like this (with “●” representing the remaining white pixel):
    
    ```
    · · ·  
    · ● ·  
    · · ·
    ```
    
    This single pixel is the ultimate reduction of the original shape.
    

---

### Thinning

- **Purpose:**  
    Thinning aims to peel away boundary layers while preserving the connectivity and general structure of the object. It is usually implemented as an iterative process where pixels are removed if their deletion does not break the object's topology.
    
- **Typical Result:**  
    The object is reduced to a “skeleton” that’s one-pixel thick, following the shape’s natural centerline.  
    **Example Visualization:**  
    For a thick “L” shape, thinning might produce a one-pixel-wide line that runs along the interior of the “L” while retaining its overall form.
    
- **Note:**  
    Although similar to skeletonizing, thinning may sometimes leave redundant pixels at junctions or endpoints, depending on the specific algorithm used.
    

---

### Skeletonizing

- **Purpose:**  
    Skeletonization extracts the medial axis of the object, representing the set of points having more than one closest point on the object’s boundary. It can be viewed as a mathematically precise way to capture the shape’s topology.
    
- **Typical Result:**  
    Like thinning, the skeleton is a one-pixel-wide representation of the object. However, skeletonization is based on distance transforms or medial-axis computations, which tend to yield a centerline that fully reflects the geometric and topological structure of the shape.  
    **Example Visualization:**  
    For a filled circle, the skeleton would be a single point (due to symmetry) or a short one-pixel line. For a more complex shape like a branching structure, it would reveal the “backbone” or centerlines of each branch.
    
- **Difference from Thinning:**  
    Although both methods aim for a one-pixel-wide result, skeletonization is often more robust at capturing the true medial axis, whereas thinning is an iterative border-peeling technique that might occasionally leave extra pixels that need to be pruned further.
    

---

### Summarizing the Three Outcomes in Rows

If you were asked to display the results in three direct rows (each row corresponding to one filter), you might expect something conceptually like this:

1. **First Row (Shrinking):**  
    Every object is reduced to its minimal form—typically a single pixel per connected component.
    
2. **Second Row (Thinning):**  
    The objects are reduced to a one-pixel-thick “trace” along their interior, preserving the overall connectivity and shape (e.g., a thick bar becomes a thin line).
    
3. **Third Row (Skeletonizing):**  
    The medial axes of the objects are extracted, resulting in one-pixel-wide representations that capture the complete topology—this may closely resemble the thinning outcome for many shapes but is derived from a different concept (the distance to the boundaries).
    

---

### Visual Example for a Simple Object

Imagine you have a symmetric, filled square:

- **Shrinking:**  
    The square would reduce ultimately to one central pixel.
    
- **Thinning:**  
    The square’s boundary would be peeled away iteratively until a one-pixel-wide cross or line remains running through the center.
    
- **Skeletonizing:**  
    The process finds the centerline (or medial axis) of the square, which for a symmetric shape may also be represented by a single central pixel, or, in the case of a rectangle, a central horizontal or vertical line.
    


# Full Study Notes on Laws’ Texture Filters, Filtering Types, and Related Concepts

These notes cover the fundamentals of Laws’ 5×5 texture filters (using the second convention), explain the differences between low-pass and high-pass filters with specific kernel labels, and include detailed explanations for exam-style true/false and short-answer questions.

---

## 1. Laws’ 5×5 Texture Filters: Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Application

- **Purpose:**  
    Laws’ texture filters are designed to extract features that characterize texture in an image. They are widely used for tasks like texture segmentation and classification because they highlight specific spatial patterns such as edges, spots, and ripples.
    
- **How They Work:**  
    A set of 1D kernels (each of length 5) is defined. The 2D filters (or masks) are then built by taking the outer product of two 1D kernels.  
    **Using the Second Convention:**
    
    - **First kernel (vertical):** Applied along the rows of the image.
        
    - **Second kernel (horizontal):** Applied along the columns of the image.
        

---

## 2. The 1D Kernels in Laws’ Method: Definitions and Filter Types

There are five basic 1D kernels. Their definitions, roles, and filtering types are summarized in the table below:

|**Kernel**|**Vector**|**Role/Description**|**Filter Type**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**L5**|`[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]`|Smoothing operator that averages pixel values and emphasizes overall luminance.|**Low Pass**|
|**E5**|`[-1, -2, 0, 2, 1]`|Edge detector that behaves like a derivative operator, highlighting rapid intensity changes.|**High Pass**|
|**S5**|`[-1, 0, 2, 0, -1]`|Spot detector that captures localized changes in texture by emphasizing high-frequency details.|**High Pass**|
|**W5**|`[-1, 2, 0, -2, 1]`|Wave detector sensitive to wave-like patterns in the image; accentuates variations in intensity.|**High Pass**|
|**R5**|`[1, -4, 6, -4, 1]`|Ripple detector that emphasizes fine details and rapid changes in the image.|**High Pass**|

> **Note:** All kernels with a zero-sum (E5, S5, W5, R5) act as high-pass filters by detecting changes in intensity, whereas L5, with positive coefficients, smooths the image.

### 2.1 Formation of 5×5 Masks

- **Constructing a Mask:**  
    Given two 1D kernels AA and BB, the outer product yields the 2D filter:
    
    Mask(i,j)=A(i)×B(j)\text{Mask}(i,j) = A(i) \times B(j)
- **Example (L5E5):**  
    Under the second convention:
    
    - **L5 (first kernel):** Applied vertically, it smooths along the rows.
        
    - **E5 (second kernel):** Applied horizontally, it computes differences along the columns.
        
    - **Result:** Since E5 calculates differences across columns, it highlights vertical edges (which create horizontal intensity differences).
        
- **Contrast with E5L5:**  
    In E5L5, E5 is applied vertically and L5 horizontally. Therefore, it tends to respond to horizontal edges.

## 3. Low-Pass vs. High-Pass Filters: Definitions and Examples

### 3.1 Definitions

- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):**
    
    - **Function:** Allows low-frequency components to pass and attenuates high-frequency components.
        
    - **Effect on Images:** Smoothes the image by reducing rapid changes (such as noise or fine details) and preserves general brightness and gradual transitions.
        
    - **Example in Laws’ Filters:**
        
        - **L5** acts as a low-pass filter.
            
- **High-Pass Filter (HPF):**
    
    - **Function:** Allows high-frequency components to pass and attenuates low-frequency components.
        
    - **Effect on Images:** Enhances edges, fine details, and textures by emphasizing sudden changes in intensity.
        
    - **Examples in Laws’ Filters:**
        
        - **E5, S5, W5, and R5** work as high-pass filters by detecting different types of rapid intensity changes.
            

### 3.2 Labelling the Kernels

|**Kernel**|**Filter Type**|**Brief Explanation**|
|---|---|---|
|**L5**|Low Pass|Smooths the image by averaging pixel values and preserving overall luminance.|
|**E5**|High Pass|Highlights edges by detecting rapid changes in intensity.|
|**S5**|High Pass|Captures spot-like features, emphasizing localized high-frequency detail.|
|**W5**|High Pass|Sensitive to wave-like patterns by accentuating periodic intensity changes.|
|**R5**|High Pass|Emphasizes fine details and ripples in the image by enhancing rapid changes.|

- **Answer:** **True**
    
- **Explanation:**
    
    - **L5L5:** Uses the L5 kernel in both directions, which smooths the image.
        
    - **Result:** It emphasizes overall luminance rather than capturing subtle textural details, leading to low discriminative power for textures with similar brightness.

    - **L5:** Functions as a low-pass filter (smoothing).
        
    - **R5:** Acts as a high-pass filter (emphasizes fine details).
        
    - **Conclusion:** Only R5 is high-pass; L5 is low-pass.
        

---

#### (e) Window Size in Texture Segmentation

- **Statement:** “In texture segmentation, using a larger window would generally do a better job at texture boundary than using a smaller window.”
    
- **Answer:** **False**
    
- **Explanation:**
    
    - **Smaller windows:** Better preserve fine details and texture boundaries.
        
    - **Larger windows:** Tend to smooth over localized variations and can blur the precise location of texture boundaries.

- **Discussion:**
    
    - This question was acknowledged as not being carefully designed, and full marks were given regardless.
        
    - **Insight:** One might argue that for a granular texture like sand, a mask that emphasizes high-frequency details (such as a high-pass mask) could capture the texture better. However, due to the question’s ambiguity, various reasonable answers exist.

    - **Unsupervised Learning:**
        
        - Works without labels, relying on inherent structure in the data.
            
        - **Examples:** K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
            

---

#### (2c) Subtracting the Local Mean in Texture Segmentation

- **Question:** “Why do we subtract the local mean from each pixel before applying the Laws filter bank?”
    
- **Answer:**
    
    - To remove illumination variations across the image.

---

#### (2d) Motivation for Dimensionality Reduction

- **Question:** “What is the motivation to perform dimensionality reduction? Name one dimensionality reduction algorithm. Do we always perform better on classification using the dimension-reduced features than the original features? Why?”
    
- **Answer Outline:**
    
    - **Motivations:**
        
        - High-dimensional data can be sparse (curse of dimensionality).
            
        - Reduces computational cost.
            
        - Helps mitigate overfitting by eliminating redundant or noisy features.
            
    - **Algorithm Example:** PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
        
    - **Performance Insight:**
        
        - Classification performance is not guaranteed to improve after dimensionality reduction because some useful information may be lost in the process.

## 5. Final Consolidated Key Takeaways

- **Laws’ Texture Filters:**
    
    - Constructed from the outer product of 1D kernels.
        
    - Under the **second convention**:
        
        - **First kernel:** Applied vertically.
            
        - **Second kernel:** Applied horizontally.
            
    - **L5E5:**
        
        - L5 (low-pass) vertically + E5 (high-pass) horizontally → best for detecting **vertical edges**.
            
    - **E5L5:**
        
        - E5 vertically + L5 horizontally → best for detecting **horizontal edges**.
            
    - **L5L5:** Provides strong smoothing but has limited discriminative power for similar luminance textures.
        
    - **R5:** Emphasizes fine details, acting as a high-pass filter.
        
    - **Kernel Labels:**
        
        - **Low Pass:** L5.
            
        - **High Pass:** E5, S5, W5, R5.
            
- **Clustering and Normalization:**
    
    - **K-Means Clustering:** Sensitive to both initialization and the choice of distance metrics.
        
    - **Normalization:** Bringing features into the range [0,1] ensures balanced contributions from each feature when computing distances.
        
- **Additional Core Concepts:**
    
    - **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:**
        
        - Supervised uses labels (e.g., SVM, Random Forest).
            
        - Unsupervised does not use labels (e.g., K-means, PCA).
            
    - **Dimensionality Reduction:**
        
        - Motivated by reducing sparsity, computational effort, and overfitting risks.
            
        - Methods like PCA may risk losing discriminative details.
            
    - **Local Mean Subtraction:**
        
        - A preprocessing step that normalizes illumination, letting the filters focus on texture patterns.
            

## A. K-Means Clustering with SSIFT

### **1. Problem Setup**

- **SSIFT Feature Vectors:**
    
    - Image 1 key-points: [0,0], [0,0.5], [0.5,0]
        
    - Image 2 key-points: [1,0], [1,1]
        
- **Initial Centroids (for 2 clusters):**
    
    - Centroid A: [0.25, 0.25]
        
    - Centroid B: [0.75, 0.75]
        
- **Distance Measure:** Use the squared Euclidean distance:
    
    Distance2=(x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2\text{Distance}^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2
- **Rule:** If a key-point is equally distant from both centroids, disregard it.

### **2. Step-by-Step K-Means Process**

#### **Step 1: Initial Assignment**

1. **Compute Distances:**
    
    - For each key-point, calculate the squared distance to Centroid A and Centroid B.
        
2. **Assign Key-points:**
    
    - **Example:**
        
        - Key-point [0,0]:
            
            - Distance to A: (0−0.25)2+(0−0.25)2=0.125(0-0.25)^2+(0-0.25)^2 = 0.125
                
            - Distance to B: (0−0.75)2+(0−0.75)2=1.125(0-0.75)^2+(0-0.75)^2 = 1.125
                
            - → **Assign to Centroid A.**
                
        - Repeat for all key-points.
            
    - **Outcome:**
        
        - Centroid A gets [0,0], [0,0.5], [0.5,0].
            
        - Centroid B gets [1,1].
            
        - [1,0] is disregarded if distances are equal.
            

#### **Step 2: Update Centroids and Reassign**

1. **Recalculate New Centroids:**
    
    - **New Centroid A:** Average of key-points assigned to A
        
        - Example: Average of [0,0], [0,0.5], [0.5,0]
            
            [0+0+0.53,0+0.5+03]≈[0.1667,  0.1667][\frac{0+0+0.5}{3}, \frac{0+0.5+0}{3}] \approx [0.1667,\; 0.1667]
    - **New Centroid B:** With just [1,1], it remains [1,1].
        
2. **Recompute Distances with New Centroids:**
    
    - Assign all key-points (including previously disregarded ones) to the closest new centroid.
        
    - **Example:**
        
        - Calculate distance for [1,0] to both new centroids.
            
    - **Outcome:**
        
        - Updated assignments might change (e.g., [1,0] might now belong to A).
            
3. **Final Centroid Update (Final Step):**
    
    - Recompute centroids based on the final assignments.
        
    - **Final Centroid A:** Average of [0,0], [0,0.5], [0.5,0], [1,0] → [0.375, 0.125].
        
    - **Final Centroid B:** Remains [1,1] (only one point).

### **3. Testing Image Classification**

- **Testing Image SSIFT Key-points:**  
    [0.5,0.5][0.5, 0.5], [0,0.25][0, 0.25], [1,1.5][1, 1.5]
    

#### **Assignment Process for Testing Image**

1. **Compute Distances with Final Centroids:**
    
    - For each testing key-point, calculate the squared distance to Final Centroid A ([0.375, 0.125]) and Final Centroid B ([1,1]).
        
    - **Example:**
        
        - [0.5, 0.5]:
            
            - Distance to A ≈ 0.15625
                
            - Distance to B ≈ 0.5
                
            - **Assigned to A.**
                
2. **Build Histogram of Counts:**
    
    - Count how many key-points fall into each cluster.
        
    - **Outcome:**
        
        - Centroid A: 2 key-points
            
        - Centroid B: 1 key-point
            

#### **Classification Rule**

- **Rule:**
    
    - If an image has **more counts for Centroid B** → **Class I**
        
    - Otherwise → **Class II**
        
- **Final Decision:**
    
    - Since Centroid A has more counts (2 vs. 1), **the testing image is classified as Class II.**

## B. Simple Explanation of LoG and DoG

### **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**

- **What It Does:**
    
    - **Blurs the image:** Removes noise or small details.
        
    - **Highlights changes:** Detects areas where brightness sharply changes (e.g., edges, corners).
        
- **Think of It As:**
    
    - Taking a picture, softening it to reduce clutter, and then finding the “interesting” spots where things change dramatically.
        

### **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)**

- **What It Does:**
    
    - Create **two blurred versions** of the same image (one lightly blurred, one heavily blurred).
        
    - **Subtract the two images:** The result highlights areas where the image details differ between the two blurs.
        
- **Think of It As:**
    
    - Comparing two slightly different versions of a blurry picture to spot the differences—these differences mark the edges or important features.
        
- **Why Use DoG:**
    
    - **Faster and simpler:** It approximates what LoG does but with less computational effort.

## C. Summary of Steps to Solve a SSIFT/K-Means Classification Problem

1. **Preparation:**
    
    - List all key-points (SSIFT feature vectors) from training images.
        
    - Set initial centroids for k-means.
        
2. **Step 1: Initial Assignment:**
    
    - Compute squared Euclidean distances from each key-point to each centroid.
        
    - Assign key-points to the closest centroid (disregard ties).
        
3. **Step 2: Update Centroids:**
    
    - For each cluster, calculate the new centroid by averaging the key-points’ coordinates.
        
    - Reassign key-points using the new centroids.
        
    - Iterate until assignments no longer change (convergence).
        
4. **Final Testing:**
    
    - Take the testing image’s key-points.
        
    - Compute distances to the final centroids.
        
    - Build a histogram counting key-point assignments per centroid.
        
    - Apply the classification rule (e.g., more points in Centroid B yields one class; otherwise another).
        
5. **Additional Insights:**
    
    - **Geometric Invariance:**
        
        - SIFT/SSIFT is robust to scaling, rotation, and translation. Even if training images are modified, the key-points and centroids remain consistent.
            
    - **DoG vs. LoG:**
        
        - DoG is preferred in practice because it is much faster (using two levels of blur and subtraction) and nearly as effective in finding key features as the mathematically heavier LoG.
