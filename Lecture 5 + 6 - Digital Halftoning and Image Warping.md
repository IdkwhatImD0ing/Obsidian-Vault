Gray-Scale Image Halftoning  

Use black-white (two-tone) images to render gray-level  
images  
n Why called halftoning?  
• Normalize intensities of gray-level images to [0,1]  
• Need to find a threshold to split it into two values – 0 or 1  
• How to do thresholding?  
• Fixed thresholding does not work properly

Printing
uses ink
dpi
rak is black dots
birhtness paper color no ink
goal rendering the illusion of gray level images on two tone devices like printers
darker region to densor black pixels per area
white is sparse black pixels
2 method
dithering and error diffusion
