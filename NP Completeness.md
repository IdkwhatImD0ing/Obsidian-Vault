## 1. Review of Linear Programming and Duality

### Linear Programming (LP)

- **Definition**: A mathematical method to find the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a model whose requirements are represented by **linear relationships**.
- **Standard Form**:
  - **Objective**: Maximize $ c^\top x $
  - **Constraints**:
    - $ A x \leq b $
    - $ x \geq 0 $
- **Variables**:
  - $ x $: Vector of variables (decision variables) we want to solve for.
  - $ c $: Coefficient vector for the objective function (representing profits, costs, etc.).
  - $ A $: Matrix representing the coefficients in the constraints.
  - $ b $: Right-hand side vector of the constraints.

**Explanation**:

- **Objective Function**: This is what we're trying to maximize or minimize. For example, maximizing profit or minimizing cost.
- **Constraints**: These are limitations or requirements that must be satisfied, such as resource availability.

**Example**:

Suppose a factory makes two products, and we want to decide how many of each to produce to maximize profit, given constraints on labor and materials.

### Duality in Linear Programming

- **Dual Problem**: For every linear programming problem (called the **primal** problem), there is a corresponding **dual** problem.
- **Primal (Original) LP**:

  Maximize:
  $$
  c^\top x
  $$
  Subject to:
  $$
  A x \leq b \\
  x \geq 0
  $$

- **Dual LP**:

  Minimize:
  $$
  b^\top y
  $$
  Subject to:
  $$
  A^\top y \geq c \\
  y \geq 0
  $$

- **Explanation**:

  - $ y $: Vector of dual variables.
  - The dual problem often provides insights into the original problem and has applications in economics and optimization.

- **Weak Duality Theorem**: The optimal value of the primal LP is less than or equal to the optimal value of the dual LP.

- **Strong Duality Theorem**: If both the primal and dual have feasible solutions, their optimal values are equal.

## 2. Computational Complexity Basics

- **Computational Complexity**: The study of the amount of resources (like time and space) required for algorithms to solve a computational problem.
- **Decision Problem**: A problem with a yes/no answer.

**Example**:

- **Decision Problem**: "Is there a path from node A to node B in this graph with length less than 5?"
- **Optimization Problem**: "What is the shortest path from node A to node B in this graph?"

---

## 3. Turing Machines and Computability

### Turing Machines (TM)

- **Definition**: An abstract model of computation that defines an idealized machine capable of manipulating symbols on an infinite tape according to a set of rules.
- **Components**:
  - **Tape**: Infinite memory divided into cells, each of which can hold a symbol.
  - **Head**: Reads and writes symbols on the tape and can move left or right.
  - **States**: The machine's internal states, which, along with the current tape symbol, determine its actions.

**Explanation**:

- Think of a Turing machine as a very simple computer that can perform basic operations, but with infinite memory.

### Computability

- **Decidable Problem**: A problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm (or Turing machine) that can provide a yes/no answer for every input in a finite amount of time.

**Example**:

- Determining whether a given number is prime is a decidable problem.

---

## 4. Complexity Classes: P, NP, and EXPTIME

### Class P (Polynomial Time)

- **Definition**: The class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.
- **Polynomial Time**: An algorithm runs in polynomial time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial expression in the size of the input.

  **Example**:

  - If an algorithm's running time is proportional to $ n^2 $, where $ n $ is the size of the input, it's a polynomial-time algorithm.

**Explanation**:

- **Polynomial Time** is considered "efficient" or "feasible" in computer science.

### Class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)

- **Definition**: The class of decision problems for which a given solution can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm.
- **Alternative Definition**: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a **nondeterministic** algorithm.

**Explanation**:

- **Nondeterministic Algorithm**: An algorithm that can make "guesses" at each step and always guesses correctly to find a solution.

- **Verification vs. Solving**:

  - In NP problems, even if finding a solution is hard, checking a proposed solution is easy (polynomial time).

**Example**:

- **Sudoku Puzzle**: Finding a solution may be hard, but checking if a filled grid is a valid solution is easy.

### Class EXPTIME (Exponential Time)

- **Definition**: Problems solvable by a deterministic algorithm in exponential time (e.g., time proportional to $ 2^{p(n)} $, where $ p(n) $ is a polynomial in the size of the input).

**Explanation**:

- **Exponential Time** algorithms are generally considered infeasible for large inputs because their running time grows very quickly as input size increases.

---

## 5. The Halting Problem

- **Definition**: The problem of determining, given a description of a Turing machine and an input, whether the Turing machine will eventually halt (stop running) or continue to run forever on that input.
- **Undecidable**: The halting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm; there's no general method to decide for all possible Turing machines and inputs.

**Importance**:

- It shows that there are fundamental limits to what can be computed.

**Example**:

- **Analogy**: You can't write a program that can examine any other program and input and always decide correctly whether it will halt or run forever.

---

## 6. Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic Turing Machines

### Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)

- **Definition**: A Turing machine where, for each state and tape symbol, the next action is uniquely determined.
- **Explanation**:

  - There is only one possible action at each step; the computation path is like a single line.

### Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NDTM)

- **Definition**: A Turing machine where, for some states and tape symbols, there can be multiple possible actions.
- **Explanation**:

  - Think of it as a machine that can "branch" into many possible computation paths simultaneously.
  - It can "guess" the correct path to reach a solution efficiently.
  - This is a theoretical model; real computers are deterministic.

---

## 7. Understanding NP and NP-Completeness

### NP Problems

- **Characteristics**:
  - Solutions can be **verified** quickly (in polynomial time).
  - Finding a solution may be hard, but checking a given solution is easy.

**Example**:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (Decision Version)**: Given a list of cities and distances, is there a route shorter than a given length? If someone provides a route, we can quickly check its length.

### P vs. NP Question

- **Big Question**: Does $ \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP} $?
  - **$ \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP} $**: Every problem that can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly.
  - **Most computer scientists believe $ \mathbf{P} \ne \mathbf{NP} $**, meaning some problems can be verified quickly but not solved quickly.

### NP-Complete Problems

- **Definition**: The hardest problems in NP. If any NP-Complete problem can be solved quickly (in polynomial time), then every problem in NP can be solved quickly.

**Properties**:

- **In NP**: Solutions can be verified in polynomial time.
- **NP-Hard**: At least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.

---

## 8. Reductions and Problem Transformations

### Problem Reduction

- **Definition**: Converting one problem into another in such a way that a solution to the second problem can be used to solve the first problem.
- **Purpose**:

  - To show that a problem is at least as hard as another known problem.

- **Polynomial-Time Reduction**:

  - A way to convert instances of problem **Y** to instances of problem **X** in polynomial time.
  - Denoted as $ Y \leq_p X $.

**Key Idea**:

- If we can reduce a known hard problem **Y** to problem **X**, then **X** must be at least as hard as **Y**.

---

## 9. Proving NP-Completeness

### Steps to Prove a Problem \( X \) is NP-Complete

1. **Show \( X \) is in NP**:

   - Provide a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify a given solution.

2. **Choose a Known NP-Complete Problem \( Y \)**:

   - Common choices are problems like **3-SAT** or **Independent Set**.

3. **Reduce \( Y \) to \( X \) (\( Y \leq_p X \))**:

   - Show how any instance of \( Y \) can be transformed into an instance of \( X \) in polynomial time.

4. **Prove Correctness**:

   - **Forward Direction**: If the instance of \( Y \) is a YES instance, then the transformed instance of \( X \) is also a YES instance.
   - **Backward Direction**: If the instance of \( X \) is a YES instance, then the original instance of \( Y \) is also a YES instance.

**Explanation**:

- By doing this, we're showing that solving \( X \) would allow us to solve \( Y \) as well.

## 10. Examples of NP-Complete Problems

### A. Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)

- **Definition**: Given a Boolean formula, determine if there exists an assignment of truth values (TRUE or FALSE) to its variables that makes the entire formula TRUE.
- **CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)**:

  - A way of structuring the formula as an AND of clauses, where each clause is an OR of literals.
  - **Literal**: A variable or its negation (e.g., $ X $ or $ \neg X $).

- **3-SAT**:

  - A special case of SAT where each clause has exactly 3 literals.
  - **3-SAT is NP-Complete**.

**Example**:

Given the formula:

$$
(X_1 \lor \neg X_2 \lor X_3) \land (\neg X_1 \lor X_2 \lor X_4) \land (\neg X_3 \lor \neg X_4 \lor X_5)
$$

Is there an assignment to \( X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5 \) that makes the formula TRUE?

**Explanation**:

- We need to find values for the variables such that each clause evaluates to TRUE.

---

### B. Independent Set Problem

- **Definition**: Given a graph, find the largest set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge.
- **Optimization Version**:

  - Find the maximum size of an independent set.

- **Decision Version**:

  - Given a graph and a number \( k \), does the graph contain an independent set of size at least \( k \)?

**NP-Completeness**:

- **In NP**:

  - Given a set of vertices, we can check in polynomial time whether it is an independent set of size \( k \).

- **NP-Hard**:

  - We can reduce the **3-SAT** problem to the Independent Set problem.

**Example**:

- Given a graph, does it have an independent set of size 4?

**Reduction from 3-SAT to Independent Set**:

- **Idea**:

  - For each clause in the 3-SAT formula, create a small group of vertices (a "gadget") representing the literals in the clause.

- **Edges**:

  - Connect vertices representing conflicting literals (e.g., \( X \) and \( \neg X \)).

- **Goal**:

  - Finding an independent set of size equal to the number of clauses corresponds to finding a satisfying assignment.

---

### C. Clique Problem

- **Definition**: Given a graph, find the largest set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in the set is connected by an edge (forming a complete subgraph).

**Relation to Independent Set**:

- **Complement Graph**:

  - The complement of a graph \( G \) is a graph \( G' \) on the same vertices where two vertices are connected in \( G' \) if and only if they are not connected in \( G \).

- **Key Point**:

  - An independent set in \( G \) corresponds to a clique in \( G' \).

**NP-Completeness**:

- Since the Independent Set problem is NP-Complete, and we can transform it to the Clique problem via complement graphs, the Clique problem is also NP-Complete.

**Example**:

- Given a graph, does it contain a clique of size 5?
