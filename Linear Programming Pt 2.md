## 1. Review of Linear Programming and Duality

### Linear Programming (LP)

- **Definition**: A mathematical method to maximize or minimize a **linear objective function** subject to a set of **linear inequalities** (constraints).
- **Standard Form**:
  - **Objective**: Maximize \( c^\top x \)
  - **Constraints**:
    - \( A x \leq b \)
    - \( x \geq 0 \)
- **Variables**:
  - \( x \): Vector of variables (decision variables).
  - \( c \): Coefficient vector for the objective function.
  - \( A \): Matrix representing constraints.
  - \( b \): Right-hand side vector of constraints.

### Duality in Linear Programming

- **Every LP has a **dual** problem**.
- **Primal (Original) LP**:

  Maximize:
  $$
  c^\top x
  $$
  Subject to:
  $$
  A x \leq b \\
  x \geq 0
  $$

- **Dual LP**:

  Minimize:
  $$
  b^\top y
  $$
  Subject to:
  $$
  A^\top y \geq c \\
  y \geq 0
  $$

- **Weak Duality Theorem**: The optimal value of the primal LP is less than or equal to the optimal value of the dual LP.
- **Strong Duality Theorem**: If both the primal and dual have feasible solutions, their optimal values are equal.

## 2. Computational Complexity Basics

- **Computational Complexity**: A field that studies the resources required (like time and space) to solve computational problems.
- **Decision Problem**: A problem with a yes/no answer.

---

## 3. Turing Machines and Computability

### Turing Machines (TM)

- **Definition**: An abstract computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936.
- **Components**:
  - **Tape**: Infinite memory divided into cells.
  - **Head**: Reads and writes symbols on the tape.
  - **States**: Defines the behavior based on current state and tape symbol.

### Computability

- **Decidable Problem**: A problem is decidable if there exists a Turing machine that halts (finishes computation) on every input and correctly decides yes/no for each instance.

---

## 4. Complexity Classes: P, NP, and EXPTIME

### Class P (Polynomial Time)

- **Definition**: The class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time (time \( O(n^k) \) for some constant \( k \)).

### Class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)

- **Definition**: The class of decision problems for which a given solution can be verified in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.
- **Alternative Definition**: Problems solvable in polynomial time by a **nondeterministic** Turing machine.

### Class EXPTIME (Exponential Time)

- **Definition**: Problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential time (time \( O(2^{p(n)}) \) where \( p(n) \) is a polynomial).

---

## 5. The Halting Problem

- **Definition**: The problem of determining, given a Turing machine and an input, whether the machine will halt or run forever.
- **Undecidable**: The halting problem cannot be solved by any Turing machine.

**Importance**:

- Many practical problems are undecidable because they can be reduced to the halting problem.

---

## 6. Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic Turing Machines

### Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM)

- **Definition**: A machine where each state and tape symbol has at most one possible action.

### Nondeterministic Turing Machine (NDTM)

- **Definition**: A machine where each state and tape symbol can have multiple possible actions (think of it as exploring many computation paths simultaneously).
- **Key Point**: While NDTMs are theoretical, they help define complexity classes like NP.

---

## 7. Understanding NP and NP-Completeness

### NP Problems

- **Characteristics**:
  - Solutions can be **verified** quickly (in polynomial time).
  - Potentially hard to **solve** quickly, but if a solution is guessed, it can be checked efficiently.

### P vs. NP Question

- **Big Question**: Does \( \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP} \)?
  - **\( \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP} \)**: Every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.
  - **Most believe \( \mathbf{P} \ne \mathbf{NP} \)**, meaning some problems can be verified quickly but not solved quickly.

### NP-Complete Problems

- **Definition**: The hardest problems in NP. If any NP-Complete problem can be solved quickly (in polynomial time), then every problem in NP can be solved quickly.
- **Properties**:
  - **In NP**: Solutions can be verified in polynomial time.
  - **NP-Hard**: As hard as the hardest problems in NP.

## 8. Reductions and Problem Transformations

### Problem Reduction

- **Definition**: Transforming one problem into another to prove statements about their complexities.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Prove NP-Completeness**: By reducing a known NP-Complete problem to another problem.
- **Polynomial-Time Reduction**:
  - A way to convert instances of problem **Y** to instances of problem **X** in polynomial time.
  - Denoted as \( Y \leq_p X \).

**Key Idea**:

- If **Y** is hard and **Y** reduces to **X**, then **X** is at least as hard as **Y**.

---

## 9. Proving NP-Completeness

### Steps to Prove a Problem \( X \) is NP-Complete

1. **Show \( X \) is in NP**:
   - Provide a polynomial-time verification algorithm.
2. **Choose a Known NP-Complete Problem \( Y \)**:
   - Example: 3-SAT.
3. **Reduce \( Y \) to \( X \) (\( Y \leq_p X \))**:
   - Show how any instance of \( Y \) can be transformed into an instance of \( X \) in polynomial time.
4. **Prove Correctness**:
   - **Forward Direction**: If the instance of \( Y \) is a YES instance, then the transformed instance of \( X \) is also a YES instance.
   - **Backward Direction**: If the instance of \( X \) is a YES instance, then the original instance of \( Y \) is also a YES instance.

## 10. Examples of NP-Complete Problems

### A. Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)

- **Definition**: Determine if there exists an assignment to variables that makes a Boolean formula TRUE.
- **CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)**:
  - A conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.
  - **Literal**: A variable or its negation.
- **3-SAT**:
  - A special case where each clause has exactly 3 literals.
- **NP-Completeness**:
  - SAT was the first problem proven to be NP-Complete (Cook-Levin Theorem).
  - 3-SAT is also NP-Complete.

**Example**:

Given the formula:

$$
(X_1 \vee \neg X_2 \vee X_3) \wedge (\neg X_1 \vee X_2 \vee X_4) \wedge (\neg X_3 \vee \neg X_4 \vee X_5)
$$

Is there an assignment to \( X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5 \) that makes the formula TRUE?

---

### B. Independent Set Problem

- **Definition**: Given a graph, find the largest set of vertices where no two are adjacent (no edge connects them).
- **Optimization Version**:
  - Find the maximum size of an independent set.
- **Decision Version**:
  - Given a graph and a number \( k \), does the graph contain an independent set of size at least \( k \)?
- **NP-Completeness**:
  - **In NP**: We can verify a solution by checking that no two selected vertices share an edge.
  - **NP-Hard**: Proven by reducing from 3-SAT.

**Example**:

Given a graph, does it have an independent set of size 4?

**Reduction from 3-SAT to Independent Set**:

- **Idea**:
  - For each clause in the 3-SAT formula, create a "gadget" in the graph.
  - **Gadget**: A set of vertices representing the literals in the clause.
  - **Edges**:
    - Connect conflicting literals (e.g., \( X \) and \( \neg X \)) across different gadgets.
- **Goal**:
  - An independent set of size equal to the number of clauses corresponds to a satisfying assignment.

---

### C. Clique Problem

- **Definition**: Given a graph, find the largest set of vertices where every pair is connected by an edge (a complete subgraph).
- **Relation to Independent Set**:
  - The **complement** of a graph \( G \) is a graph \( G' \) where edges are replaced by non-edges and vice versa.
  - **Key Point**: An independent set in \( G \) corresponds to a clique in \( G' \).
- **NP-Completeness**:
  - Since Independent Set is NP-Complete, and there's a polynomial-time reduction between Independent Set and Clique, Clique is also NP-Complete.

**Example**:

Given a graph, does it contain a clique of size 5?

  - Abstract models of computation.
  - **Deterministic**: One computation path.
  - **Nondeterministic**: Multiple computation paths (think of "guessing" the right path).

### Memorization Techniques

- **Use Analogies**:
  - **Independent Set**: Think of selecting a group of people who don't know each other at a party.
  - **Clique**: Think of a group where everyone knows each other.

### Summary of Steps to Prove NP-Completeness

1. **Show the Problem is in NP**:
   - Can you verify a solution quickly?

2. **Select a Known NP-Complete Problem**:
   - Common choices: SAT, 3-SAT, Independent Set.

3. **Reduce the Known Problem to Your Problem**:
   - Construct a transformation that converts instances of the known problem to instances of your problem.

4. **Prove Both Directions**:
   - **If** the original instance is a YES-instance, **then** the transformed instance is a YES-instance.
   - **If** the transformed instance is a YES-instance, **then** the original instance is a YES-instance.
