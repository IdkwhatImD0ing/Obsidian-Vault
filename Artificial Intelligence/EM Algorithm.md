Expectation Maximization/Estimation Modification
It is not an algorithm, it is a framework

Not a singular algorithm, can be applied in multiple places.

General Idea:
- Training (parameter estimation or maximum likelihood estimation)
	- Find a model with parameters that probability is maximum
	- Update assignment (data to cluster)
- Maximize (classification, prediction, expectation maximization)
	- Predict a class C where probability is maximum
	- Update means (adjust clusters)

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

### Maximum Likelihood Principle

Given: Data X
Assumption: Data is generated by some model f(O)
- F ... model
- O ... model parameters
Want to estimate P(X|O)
- Probability that our model f with parameters O generated the data
Now need to find the most likely model that could have generated the data arg max P(X|O)

Example

Imagine given a set of coin flips
Task: Find bias of coin

Data sequence of coin flips X = \[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]
What is P(X|O)?
