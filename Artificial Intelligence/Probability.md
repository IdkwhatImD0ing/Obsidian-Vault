## Basic Definitions

- P(X}: Probability X
- P(X^Y): Probability X and Y
- P(X | Y): Probability X if Y

## Two Key Concepts

- Probability Distribution Model
	- Real World
		- Possible worlds
		- Atomic Events
		- Samples
	- Mind
		- Variables
		- Value assignments (entailment)
	- Deviation
		- How spread is the distribution
	- Variance
		- How widely is the distribution spread
		- Deviation squared
- Inferences that can be made from the model
	- Sum rule
	- Product Rule
	- Conditional
	- Marginalization
	- Normalization
