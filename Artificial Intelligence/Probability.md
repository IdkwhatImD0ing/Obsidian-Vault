## Basic Definitions

- P(X}: Probability X
- P(X^Y): Probability X and Y
- P(X | Y): Probability X if Y

### Formal Definition

Set Omega - Sample Space
	Eg 6 possible rolls of dice

Probability space is defined as a triple (Ω, F, P), where Ω is the sample space, F is the set of events, and P is the probability measure defined on F.

An event A is any subset of the sample space Ω, and the probability of event A, denoted P(A), is the measure of the set A according to the probability measure P.




## Two Key Concepts

- Probability Distribution Model
	- Real World
		- Possible worlds
		- Atomic Events
		- Samples
	- Mind
		- Variables
		- Value assignments (entailment)
	- Deviation
		- How spread is the distribution
	- Variance
		- How widely is the distribution spread
		- Deviation squared
	- Distributions
		- Fully Joint Probability Table
			- Multiple Probability Tables joined together
			- Possible worlds are mutually explosive
				- Cannot have multiple worlds at once
			- Possible worlds are exhaustive
				- All of the probabilities add to 1
- Inferences that can be made from the model
	- Sum rule
	- Product Rule
	- Conditional
	- Marginalization
	- Normalization
